    <h1> Welcome to Vi's Page !!!</h1>
    <p> I'm Intan Oktavia, i actually loves to be called Vi.
        I'm 20 years old by 16th this October (not so excited to be 20 tho).
        I love lots of thing, books, writings dan journalism, make up, music, sleep, sleep, sleep and sleep.
        i'm a girlie girl who is lost in this engineering world. i personally think i'm more suitable to be
        in social science field but IDK WHY I ENDED UP HERE. well, the world doesnt always go well for everyone.
        i dont really enjoy codes, NO NO, more like i dont really enjoy college.
        if i could transform myself to be a broccoli i'd be glad to sell my soul for it.
        so, hello again. I'm Vi and i'd like to be a broccoli! </p>
